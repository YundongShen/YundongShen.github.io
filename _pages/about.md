I have a broad interest in AI for Drug Discovery/Biology/Chemistry.


I have been worked in the AI for Science lab at the California Institute of Technology with [Prof. Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) and [Dr. Shengchao Liu](https://chao1224.github.io/) on molecule geometry learning. I also have a close collaboration with [Prof. Hongyu Guo](https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/members/4499/profile?embed=2) from the University of Ottawa and NRC Canada.
I obtained my Master's degree in Computational Biology from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in 2023. During my time at CMU, I worked with [Prof. Hosein Mohimani](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/mohimani.html) in natural antibiotics prediction from microbial genome. Meanwhile, I worked with [Prof. David Ryan Koes](https://www.csb.pitt.edu/people/faculty/david-koes/) and Ph.D. student [Andrew McNutt](https://drewnutt.github.io/) from the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) on deep-learning-based knowledge distillation for a protein-ligand docking tool [GNINA](https://github.com/gnina/gnina). These experiences initialized my interest in computational drug design.

I also have dual Bachelor's degrees from [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/) in China and [Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven) in Belgium (sponsored as an exchange student).

### Besides Research
* **[Bye Marco Reus - Captain of Dortmund forever](https://bvbbuzz.com/posts/marco-reus-leave-borussia-dortmund)** I am a fan of [Borussia Dortmund](https://www.bvb.de/eng), a soccer club in Bundesliga. I have been to Westfalenstadion in the Signal Iduna Park in German to support the team.
* Cartoon character [Crayon Shin-chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon_Shin-chan) always helps me find warmth in the mundane and feel the beauty of life. He inspires me to take responsibility in my family and provide a better life for my loved ones.
